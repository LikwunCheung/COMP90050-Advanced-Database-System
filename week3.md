# Week 3

### Fault tolerance

the **failure is independent**.

Probability a particular module is not available: 

   = MTTR/(MTTF+MTTR)     ≅ MTTR/MTTF   if MTTF >> MTTR

##### Software reliability

* design and coding faults
* N-version programming
* Bohrbugs  -> deterministic  bugs
* Heisenbugs -> software errors that only appear occasionally 
* Periodic transfer of data: primary; The second
* Checkpoint-restart



Summary

* Improving Hardware reliability that is CPUs, Memory and Storage Units. This can be done by employing lot of redundancy such as   N-plex systems. 
* Software reliability can be improved by employing process-pairing or transaction based recovery.
